## !! Disclaimer !!

Package is still an alpha-version and under active development.
As of now do not expect anything to work! APIs are going to change,
stuff breaks and the documentation may lack behind. Nevertheless, feel
free to take a look. The safest point to start is probably the API reference.

## Install Environment

You need to intall Anaconda@3.10.9 64-bit.

```sh
$ pip install pyadlml[complete]
```

or

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
